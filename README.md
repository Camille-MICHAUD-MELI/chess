Chess
--------------
I haven't coded a chess program yet, so here I give it a try in Java!

To Do
--------------
- Check if it is checkmate

Credits

- My childhood chess mentors Ted and Paul
- Mom for setting up her library's chess program and bringing home a chess set
- Mr. Boyt and my middle school chess team friends
