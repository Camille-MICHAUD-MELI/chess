I haven't coded a chess program yet, so here I give it a try in Java!

<h4>To Do</h4>
- Implement client/server functionality

<h4>Credits</h4>
- My childhood chess mentors Ted and Paul
- Mom for setting up her library's chess program and bringing home a chess set
- Mr. Boyt and my middle school chess team friends
- Wikipedia for piece images
