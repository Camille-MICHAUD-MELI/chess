Chess
--------------
I haven't coded a chess program yet, so here I give it a try in Java!

To Do
--------------
- Start moving pieces with mouse clicks

Credits
--------------
- My childhood chess mentors Ted and Paul
- Mom for setting up her library's chess program and bringing home a chess set
- My chess team friends in middle school. Thanks Augustus Fei, Ryan Walsh, Scott Ma, Suriya Baskar, and all those I've forgotten for some great experiences!
